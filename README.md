Power BI & Python | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Data Visualization

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes daily coffee sales trends using Power BI and Python. The goal is to understand sales patterns, identify top-selling coffee types, and track monthly sales trends over time.

🚀 Key Objectives:
✅ Clean and preprocess raw sales data using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
✅ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights
✅ Visualize key metrics and trends using Power BI
✅ Identify top-selling coffee types and seasonal patterns
✅ Share insights through interactive dashboards
